medical research, cosmetic and clothing industry. Currently, more than 1000 manufacturers
identified (MNPs) nanotechnology-based consumer products are available in the market and still
the production of other nano-materials (NMs) are increasing at a staggering rate due to the growing
demand for nano-based products on a larger scale. Quantitative Nanostructure-Activity
Relationships (QNAR) modeling plays an important role in allowing rapid prediction of potential
toxicities caused by diverse types of MNPs prior to experimental evaluation. In order to
develop robust and statistically significant models, it is quite essential to have prior
information on all the elements (Metals, non-metals, and semimetals) present in the nano-based
compounds in addition to the descriptors calculated by using other software.

## Why MaDGen?

MaDGeN (Material Descriptor GENerator) is the web-based tool that helps the researcher to calculate some of the fundamental descriptors of their compounds. MaDGeN is not a replacement of any descriptor generator tool, in contrary it helps the researcher to generate the most basic descriptors on the go (like you are travel and you urgently some descriptors and have only smartphone) and also emplys the existing descriptor generating frameworks.
MaDGeN is created with aim to generate descriptors using any devices (mobile phones/tablets/laptops). It's interface is desingned with emphasis to use in small devices.

### How to use MaDGeN?
Currently MadGen supports the following input features:
1. **Elemental**: To generate descriptors for elements
2. **Compound SMILES**: To generate descriptors for compounds
3. **From Files**: To generate descriptors from files.

Under the hood MadGeN converts the smiles in to formulas and process the formulas for the first and second gen decriptors, which made it can be used also for the inorganic compounds, in upcoming version we will include the direct formula input for the inorganic compounds.

Who can use MadGen?
Currently this tool is limited to Humans.
